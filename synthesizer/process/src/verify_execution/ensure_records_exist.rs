// The checks in this file ensure that every Transition t in the given execution satisfies the following:
//
// Guarantee (G): Every non-static record (DynamicRecord or ExternalRecord) input to t or received by t from a
// function call is "connected" to a static Record which exists on the ledger at the end of the full execution
// (whether consumed or not).
//
// Here "connected" refers to the transitive relation between two or more record-like (Record, DynamicRecord or
// ExternalRecord) registers that arises when one of the following happens:
// - two of them coincide at the input or output boundary of a function call
// - two of them are related by a cast-to-dynamic instruction
//
// The following is required of every function in the execution:
//
// Contract (C): Every record-like register output or passed to a function call exists on the ledger at the end of the
// full execution.
//
// When ensuring (C), the function can assume its caller and callees (if any) also satisfy (C). Note that (C) does
// not refer to connected registers generally, but to the specific registers involved in the statement. In particular,
// (C) must be satisfied regardless of the specific operations happening inside the function's callees. For instance,
//  - A function f that mints a static Record at register r0 and passes it to an external function must output r0. It
//    is not sufficient for f to subsequently call an external "remapper function" which effectively returns the same
//    Record at r1, and then output r1.
//  - If a function f receives a DynamicRecord from a callee at r2, it is itself free to output r2, since the callee's
//    contract already guarantees that r2 corresponds to a static Record on the ledger.
//
// (G) and (C) can be ensured as follows:
//
//   1. Keeping track of each DynamicRecord and ExternalRecord register input to the root call as it travels across
//   function and closure input or output boundaries and cast-to-dynamic (in the external case) instructions, and
//   ensuring that one register connected to it is input to a function receiving it as a static Record (thus
//   consuming it). We refer to this as the *global check*.
//
//   This property depends on the root call of a Transaction and the flow of the execution and is therefore in the
//   hands of the party authorising the Transaction (and not in those of the developer of an Aleo program).
//
//   N.B.: It can be shown that materialization of a non-static record input to the root transition cannot occur due to
//   a connected static Record being output (by a function in the program containing the record definition) - at least,
//   not without first materializing it by consuming it as a static-Record input.
//
//   2. Ensuring that, in each transition t in the execution, if a static Record R_s is
//   minted locally and either
//    - passed to a callee.
//    - cast to a DynamicRecord R_d which is then passed to a callee or output.
//   then R_s is itself output. We refer to this as the *local check*. Note that, in case b), if the callee
//   would receive the value as a static Record, this would constitute an attempt to consume a Record which has not
//   been published yet. Since such an execution would be rejected during verification time (whether the
//   inclusion-proof check happens before or after the record-existence one), we allow the record-existence check to
//   reject such an execution even though it does not violate (C) (this slightly simplifies the implementation). This
//   Record -> Record boundary cannot occur in case a), as it would either be a local static call or a dynamic call
//   receiving a static-Record input and both are disallowed.
//
//   This property depends on the definition of the functions involved and is therefore in the hands of the developers
//   Aleo programs.
//
// The function ensure_records_exist explores the execution tree recursively starting at the root Transition and
// processing instructions (input/output boundaries, function calls, Record mintings and cast-to-dynamic instructions)
// in order of execution. It also ensures that no closure outputs ExternalRecord or DynamicRecord types, which is
// enforced at deployment time for V15+ programs and checked at runtime for pre-V15 programs. Closure calls do not
// need to be explored since they cannot output Records, DynamicRecords or ExternalRecords and therefore cannot
// influence any of the checks above (in particular, they cannot lead to connections between Record-like registers
// in the caller).
//
// When a function call is encountered, the function process_transition is called. This initialises a
// FunctionLocalCheck struct which keeps track of which locally minted static Records are passed to callees; or cast to
// dynamic and passed to callees or output.
//
// If the function corresponds to the root transition, a GlobalCheck is also initialised with one singleton family per
// non-static Record input. This object is passed across all recursive calls.
//
// process_transition processes the following situations:
//
//     - Case 1: RecordWithDynamicID and Record registers input to the function, whose families are marked as
//       existing if they are being tracked (global check)
//     - Case 2: connections between the caller registers where call inputs are passed and the callee's input
//       registers (global check).
//     - Case 3: cast instruction minting a static Record (local check)
//     - Case 4: casts of ExternalRecords to DynamicRecords (global check; note an external record cannot be
//       minted locally)
//     - Case 5: casts of locally minted static Records to DynamicRecords (local check)
//     - Function calls, at which point process_transition is called recursively. Two situations are kept track of
//       at the input boundary:
//         - Case 6a: Locally minted static Records passed as inputs, which must be output by the caller (local
//           check)
//         - Case 6b: DynamicRecords cast from locally minted static Records and passed as inputs, in which case the
//           static ones must be output by the caller (local check)
//     - Case 7: DynamicRecords cast from locally minted static Records and output (local check)
//     - Case 8: Connections between the caller registers where call outputs are received and call and the callee's
//       output registers (global check).
